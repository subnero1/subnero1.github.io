The standalone configuration (SC) is equipped with a pressure housing customized for diverse deployment depths. These configurations are prepared for underwater deployment utilizing underwater cables and can be powered by an external power supply from the surface or an underwater battery.


Conversely, the OEM configuration (OC) is designed for seamless integration into subsea platforms including AUVs, ROVs, and sensor systems. These configurations include the electronic stack, supported cables, and transducers, which the user is responsible for integrating with their platform.
