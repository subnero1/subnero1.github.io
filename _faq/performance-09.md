Yes, Gen 4 modems have a compatibility mode that allows it to work with Gen3 modems. Users can use the script in unet-contrib repo to enable the compatibility mode: [https://github.com/org-arl/unet-contrib/tree/master/contrib/unetstack3-compat](https://github.com/org-arl/unet-contrib/tree/master/contrib/unetstack3-compat).
