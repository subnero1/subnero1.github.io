UnetStack is freely available for academic use from [www.unetstack.net](www.unetstack.net). UnetStack is based on the open source fj√•ge framework that you'll find at [https://github.com/org-arl/fjage](https://github.com/org-arl/fjage). Not all of UnetStack is open source, although you can download the binaries and use them for academic development at no cost. UnetStack is, however, open architecture and you can extend it without needing access to the source code. [www.unetstack.net](www.unetstack.net) shows you how to do this. There are some open source contributions to UnetStack that you can find at [https://github.com/org-arl/unet-contrib](https://github.com/org-arl/unet-contrib).
