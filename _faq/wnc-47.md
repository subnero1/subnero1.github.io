Yes, Subnero modems run UnetStack which provides a complete network stack that supports one to many communication as well as full network connectivity. Refer to unet handbook on how to setup small underwater networks using [UnetStack](https://unetstack.net/handbook/unet-handbook_setting_up_small_networks.html).
