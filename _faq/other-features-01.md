Yes, users are able to access both baseband as well as passband samples of the raw data over any of the software interfaces available (Java, Groovy, Python, C, Julia or Matlab). Details are available in the unet handbook: [https://unetstack.net/handbook/unet-handbook_baseband_service.html](https://unetstack.net/handbook/unet-handbook_baseband_service.html).
