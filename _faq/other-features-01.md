Yes, users are able to access both baseband as well as passband samples of the raw data over any of the software interfaces available (Java, Groovy, Python, C, Julia etc.) over the Ethernet interface. Details are available in the unet handbook: [https://unetstack.net/handbook/unet-handbook_baseband_service.html](https://unetstack.net/handbook/unet-handbook_baseband_service.html).
