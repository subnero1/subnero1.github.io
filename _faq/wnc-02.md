Our modems are available in the following configurations:

**Standalone Configuration**: The standalone configuration (SC) comes with a pressure housing to support different deployment depths. It operates on an external power source, such as a battery for underwater deployments or a power supply when deployed from the water surface. This configuration offers maximum flexibility and reliability in a wide range of deployment scenarios. Read more about the SC [here](https://subnero.com/products/wnc-m25mss4.html).

**OEM Configuration**: The OEM configuration (OC) is specifically tailored for seamless integration and adaptability. It is an ideal choice for incorporation into larger platforms, such as AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), and sensors. The OEM configuration enables easy integration and provides versatility for diverse applications. For free flooded platforms, we also offer a pressure hull option.

**Multi-channel Configuration**: Our multi-channel smart modems come with multiple synchronous receiving channels, allowing for efficient processing and optimization of data transfer in a given environment. This configuration enhances communication performance by improving speed, reliability, and reducing errors and interference. The multi-channel configuration is particularly beneficial for applications that require high-speed and reliable underwater communication.
