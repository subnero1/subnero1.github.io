Acoustic modems face several challenges due to the complex and unpredictable nature of underwater environments. Factors such as multipath scattering, absorption due to salt ions, refraction due to temperature variation, scattering from bubbles and suspended sediment, noise due to marine animals and human activity, and Doppler due to relative motion can significantly affect communication quality.

To overcome these challenges, techniques optimized for underwater environments are essential. Adaptive modulation can help cope with dynamic conditions, ensuring optimal performance despite changes in the environment. Acoustic smart modems can also analyze and process data locally, transmitting only relevant snippets to conserve bandwidth and energy. By incorporating machine learning for content-aware data processing, these smart modems can intelligently prioritize data, making efficient use of limited resources.
