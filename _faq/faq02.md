Acoustic modems face several challenges due to the unique properties of underwater environments. One primary issue is the slow propagation speed of sound in water, which is about 200,000 times slower than electromagnetic waves. This delay causes significant latency in communication, making acoustic modems unsuitable for real-time applications over long distances, such as remote controlling underwater drones. Additionally, the available acoustic bandwidth is limited, typically operating in the kilohertz range. This results in data rates of only a few bits to tens of kilobits per second, which is tiny compared to the hundreds of Megabits per second we are accustomed to on land.


Another major challenge is the impact of relative motion between the transmitter and receiver, which causes Doppler that complicates communication. Shallow water environments, like those in ports and coastal areas, often create multi-path interference due to reflections, further degrading communication performance. The underwater environment is also highly dynamic, with varying conditions across different geographies and times. Biological noises and disturbances from wind, surf, or ship propellers can significantly affect underwater communication channels, making it difficult for traditional systems to maintain consistent performance.


To overcome these challenges, techniques optimized for underwater environments are essential. Adaptive modulation can help cope with dynamic conditions, ensuring optimal performance despite changes in the environment. Acoustic smart modems can also analyze and process data locally, transmitting only relevant snippets to conserve bandwidth and energy. By incorporating machine learning for content-aware data processing, these smart modems can intelligently prioritize data, making efficient use of limited resources.
