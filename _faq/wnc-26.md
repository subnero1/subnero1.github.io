Yes, Gen 4 smart modems have a compatibility mode that allows it to work with Gen3 modems. Users can use the script in [unet-contrib](https://github.com/org-arl/unet-contrib/) repo to enable the compatibility mode: [https://github.com/org-arl/unet-contrib/tree/master/contrib/unetstack3-compat](https://github.com/org-arl/unet-contrib/tree/master/contrib/unetstack3-compat).
