One potential solution is to get 2 multi-channel modems with 4 channels each and combine the data. This will provide you 2 sets of 4 channel synchronous sampled data. Combining the data is relatively easy with UnetStack, and on the software side you'll see it as a single modem. We should be able to provide you with a simple demonstration app that shows how to do this. You can develop this later to a full application based on your use case.
