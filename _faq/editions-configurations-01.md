Subnero underwater modems are available in three distinct editions: Platinum, Silver, and Research. Here's an overview of each edition:

**Platinum Edition**: Our Platinum Edition modems are specifically designed and built for reliability. They are the preferred choice for customers who require devices certified for various environmental qualifications. Some of these qualifications include:
- MIL-STD-810G (temperature, vibration, salinity, humidity)
- MIL-STD-810E (air transportation, shock)
- and MIL-STD-461E (EMI/EMC).

Before shipment, all Platinum Edition devices undergo rigorous environmental stress screening at both the PCBA and unit levels. Additionally, they meet the IPC class 2 workmanship requirement of PCBA and are conformally coated. The technical specifications such as data rate, range, power consumption, and frequency band of operation remain the same across all editions. For detailed technical specifications, please refer to the modem specifications sheet available [here](https://subnero.com/quicklinks/).

**Silver Edition**: The Silver Edition underwater modem serves as the workhorse communication node for general commercial deployments. It offers a larger communication range and depth-rating compared to the Research Edition modem. This edition is suitable for a wide range of applications where reliable and robust communication is essential.

**Research Edition**: Our research edition modems are designed to bridge the gap between developing applications using a simulator and high-end commercial deployments. Due to its low cost, these modems provide an easier entry to the world of underwater communications to any underwater technology enthusiasts.. However, it is important to note that these modems are not recommended for long deployments in open water environments like seas or oceans. The Research Edition offers a more affordable option while still providing reliable communication capabilities.

We encourage you to visit our [website](https://subnero.com/products/modem.html) for more detailed information on all three editions. Our modems provide options for customization and extension at multiple levels, facilitating the implementation and testing of network/routing protocols as per your specific requirements.
