If you plan to use Subnero modems, they are pre-loaded with UnetStack. You may refer to this article on building a DIY underwater modem using [UnetStack](https://blog.unetstack.net/Project-Sabine-Low-cost-DIY-underwater-modem-using-COTS-components-and-Unet-audio). 

For support with third-party modems, please contact us at info@subnero.com and we will be more than happy to assist in providing details about the UnetStack OEM edition.
