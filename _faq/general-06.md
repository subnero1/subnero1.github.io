There isn't any export restriction on the M25M series of modems. The S60H modems will need an EUS (End User Statement) so that we can apply for an export license before they can be shipped to the end-user.

> NOTE: Subnero Pte Ltd shall not be obligated to fulfill the order if such fulfillment is prevented by any impediments arising out of national or international foreign trade or customs requirements or any embargoes (or other sanctions).
