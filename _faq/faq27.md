Yes, Subnero modems can interoperate with third-party devices that support standards like JANUS or SWiG Acoustic Level 1. Users can also implement custom communication algorithms for real-time interoperability. Over the years, Subnero modems have demonstrated interoperability with various third-party modems (commercial or research variants).
