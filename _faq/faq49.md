Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) measure ocean currents and waves, providing critical data for fields like oceanography and meteorology. Typically deployed on the seabed for extended periods, ensuring their functionality and data reliability is crucial. Traditional methods like manual retrieval or underwater cables are costly, risky, and prone to failures.

Acoustic modems offer a safer, cost-effective alternative by enabling wireless communication between the seabed and the surface. This approach eliminates the need for physical retrieval or cumbersome cables, ensuring continuous monitoring and reliable data collection, enhancing our ability to understand marine environments.
