The modems support different types of data types such as telemetry/status information from marine robots, command and control data, sensor payloads. The CONTROL channel can be used for telemetry/status information as well as command and control data. The DATA channel can be used for mission related data as well as payload information. Content Aware Processing is also supported by UnetStack and various data types can be tagged by the user for processing differently by the stack.
