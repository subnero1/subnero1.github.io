Subnero modems come with a free 1 year limited warranty coverage for defective parts. Please see below for an overview of warranty coverage.

| Item | 1st Year Warranty  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Labor       | 100%        |
| Software & UI  | 100%     |
| Shipping (local in Singapore) | 100% |

*Note: Parts may be charged separately depending on the condition.*

In summary, warranty covers manufacturing defects, and rectifies faults on a best-effort basis free of charge.

Additional support (business hours 8x5 via email & telephone) is available for purchase along with standard orders.
