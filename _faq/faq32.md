Subnero modems support three wake-up modes:
1. Scheduled wake-up: Configure wake-up schedules using the modemâ€™s in-built scheduler.
2. External interrupt: Trigger wake-ups using an external interrupt with a 3.3V external signal more than 100 ms.
3. Power cycle: Disconnect and reconnect power to wake up the modem.
