Since Subnero smart modems are software defined, you can always use the modem to do ambient noise recordings and use the recordings as the data payload (generated data) for testing your routing algorithms. Additionally, most Silver Edition modems come with a depth and temperature sensor by default. However, if you want any specific sensors (e.g. temperature, pressure etc.), we can always integrate them with the modems. Refer to the [SWIS - ADCP edition](https://subnero.com/solutions/swis) for details of integrated ADCPs with Subnero modems.
