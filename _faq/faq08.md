The multi-channel acoustic smart modems offer a distinct advantage due to their multiple synchronous receiving channels. This directly leads to enhanced communication performance as spatial diversity is harnessed to improve communication quality. Depending on channel conditions, the communication performance can more than double that of its single-channel counterpart. Furthermore, with appropriate software update, this device can function as a USBL (Ultra Short Baseline) system with custom, user defined, expanded aperture, enabling precise target tracking. It supports both regular and inverted USBL configurations. Lastly, the multichannel modem serves as a versatile passive acoustic monitoring device, adding to its array of capabilities.
For further insights into the advantages of a multichannel modem, you can explore a magazine article detailing some of these benefits [here](https://lsc-pagepro.mydigitalpublication.com/publication/?m=60787&i=727818&p=17&ver=html5).
