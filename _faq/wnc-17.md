While it is not recommended, it should be OK if not done for prolonged durations. The operating temperature is 55 deg C. While doing sea trials, we leave the modems on the boat, without sun protection, between deployment locations. The modems have thermal shut down capabilities. Still, we would recommend avoiding long periods of exposure to direct sunlight.
