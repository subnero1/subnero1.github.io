In Singapore waters, 2-4 km at 100 to 2,000 bps depending on channel conditions. Higher rates of up to 10,000 bps are possible at short ranges in good channel conditions. Singapore is among the noisier waters in the world, and the water is filled with micro-bubbles from ship wakes. We expect better performance in other waters, subject to the local sound speed profile allowing acoustic propagation between the locations of interest.
