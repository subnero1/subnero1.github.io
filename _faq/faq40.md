Users have access to the processing unit inside the modem by developing their own UnetStack agents in Java or Groovy. These agents can be managed through the modemâ€™s web-based UI for seamless integration and control.

For processor intensive tasks, optional coprocessors like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano are available, allowing users to run custom algorithms on an additional SBC.
