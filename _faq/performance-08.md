title: Does the modem ship with any demo sensor? Is there any option for interfacing any external sensors to these modems?, if yes, what is the minimal cost of these compatible sensors?

Since Subnero modems are software defined, you can always use the modem to do ambient noise recordings and use the recordings as the data payload (generated data) for testing your routing algorithms. This avoids the need for a separate sensor just for data generation (also helps keep cost low). However, if you want any specific sensors (e.g. temperature, pressure etc.), we can always integrate them with the modems. Refer to SWIS - ADCP edition for details of integrated ADCPs with Subnero modems: [https://subnero.com/solutions/swis](https://subnero.com/solutions/swis).
