Subnero modems are available in Platinum, Silver, and Research editions. The Platinum Edition is certified for various environmental qualifications including MIL-STD-810 and MIL-STD-461, undergoes rigorous stress screening, and meets the IPC class 2 workmanship requirement. The Silver Edition offers a larger communication range and depth rating and is suitable for applications where reliable communication is needed. The Research Edition modems are designed to bridge the gap between developing applications using a simulator and high-end commercial deployments, but are not recommended for long deployments in open water environments.
