Subnero modems support Frequency Hopping Binary Frequency Shift Keying (FH-BFSK) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) for CONTROL and DATA channels, with user customization options. An auxiliary channel supports standards like JANUS and SWiGAcoustic Level 1, and a user-defined channel allows custom modulation schemes.
