The Lloyd’s mirror effect occurs when sound waves from a source interfere with their reflections off the water surface, causing signal fading and distortion near the surface. This phenomenon can reduce communication reliability and increase error rates, especially in shallow deployments. Positioning modems at greater depths helps mitigate these effects.
