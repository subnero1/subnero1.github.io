Similar to a smartphone, an acoustic smart modem is a sophisticated device designed for intelligent underwater wireless communication. An acoustic smart modem, such as those offered by Subnero, understands various applications and the data to be transferred. These modems can optimize power and bandwidth utilization, adjust to changing environmental conditions, and support heterogeneous networking, extending internet-like connectivity underwater. This makes them invaluable for applications requiring reliable and efficient underwater communication.
