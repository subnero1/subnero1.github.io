An acoustic smart modem is a sophisticated device designed for underwater wireless communication. Terrestrial wireless technologies using radio-frequency electromagnetic waves are ineffective underwater because they are rapidly absorbed by water. Instead, underwater communication relies on acoustics, which can travel much farther in this medium. An acoustic modem converts digital data into acoustic waves, transmitting these through water to a receiving modem that converts them back into digital data.


However, the underwater environment presents unique challenges such as multipath scattering, absorption due to salt ions, refraction due to temperature variation, scattering from bubbles and  suspended sediment, noise due to marine animals and human activity, and Doppler due to relative motion. These factors can significantly impact communication quality. To address these issues, acoustic smart modems, like those offered by Subnero, employ advanced technologies and algorithms. These modems can optimize power and bandwidth utilization, adjust to changing environmental conditions, and support heterogeneous networking, extending internet-like connectivity underwater. This makes them invaluable for applications requiring reliable and efficient underwater communication.
