If you are an OEM developer, you can license the UnetStack OEM Edition through Subnero and design your modem hardware around it. For non-commercial users, such as technical enthusiasts, UnetStack provides tools and guidance for building your own modems using off-the-shelf components. A detailed step-by-step process can be found in this [blog article](https://blog.unetstack.net/Project-Sabine-Low-cost-DIY-underwater-modem-using-COTS-components-and-Unet-audio).

If you develop a UnetStack-based modem, feel free to reach out to Subnero so we can feature your project through our social media channels.

For detailed information about the various editions and their applications, refer to this whitepaper: [https://subnero.com/brochures/unlocking-underwater-connectivity.pdf](https://subnero.com/brochures/unlocking-underwater-connectivity.pdf)
