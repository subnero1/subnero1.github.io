Subnero attended its first in-person exhibition during [Ocean Business](https://noc-events.co.uk/ocean-business-2021){:target="_blank"}, in Southampton, UK.

The event took place at the National Oceanography Centre from the 12th to the 14th of October 2021, after being postponed because of the pandemic. 

It was so nice to meet for the team to talk about our technology in person.

We loved being part of the event.

We look forward to attending the next in person exhibition [Oceanology International 2022](https://www.oceanologyinternational.com/london/en-gb.html), in London, UK, in March 2022.
