We have 3 quick updates: 

1. UnetStack and simulator v1.3 released.
2. Tutorial on Underwater Acoustic Networking at OCEANS ’16.
3. Meet us at OCEANS ’16.

### UnetStack and simulator v1.3 released.

[UnetStack and simulator v1.3](https://unetstack.net/){:target="_blank"} is now available for download. This release comes with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which includes all required tools and dependencies to quickly start developing and simulating underwater networks.

Highlights:

- New integrated development environment (IDE).
- Declarative [PDU framework](https://unetstack.net/handbook/unet-handbook_implementing_network_protocols.html#_simple_mac_with_handshake){:target="_blank"} to make packet encoding and decoding a breeze.
- Declarative [finite state machine (FSM) framework](https://unetstack.net/handbook/unet-handbook_implementing_network_protocols.html#_simple_mac_with_handshake){:target="_blank"} to enable you to focus on protocol logic, rather than FSM programming.
- [Tutorial](https://unetstack.net/handbook/unet-handbook_medium_access_control.html){:target="_blank"} to demonstrate the new frameworks, and to get you started on developing your own medium access control (MAC) agents.

Check out v1.3 release notes for a complete list of new features, changes and bug fixes.
