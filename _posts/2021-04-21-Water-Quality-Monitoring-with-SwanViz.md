As part of a collaborative project with the National University of Singapore, Subnero has been working on improving the [SWAN](https://subnero.com/products/swan.html) solution to incorporate intelligent mission planning capabilities. To that effect, the SwanBots (SWAN robots) will be capable of learning from the  data collected while exploring an area, to dynamically update an ongoing mission to gather more useful data, in real-time. This enhances the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of SWAN as a water quality monitoring solution.

The project also involves the development of an interactive user interface for real-time data visualization and water quality monitoring using the SwanBots.

The interactive user interface, better known as the SwanViz, is a cloud-based web application that has been developed together with [CSSSR](https://csssr.com/en). The user-friendly interface with a simple dashboard and enhanced data visualization has been designed and developed by the CSSSR team.

The new SwanViz features a dashboard which showcases an overview of various SwanBots deployed in different areas, including its mission and health status. The SwanViz is accessible via a computer (desktop/laptop) or mobile devices.

The SwanViz also allows users to view and configure SwanBots for various types of water quality monitoring missions from the comfort of their offices. It also enables the water quality data collected by the SwanBot to be viewed in real-time, in the form of heatmaps and data plots.
