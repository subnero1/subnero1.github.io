The Singapore autonomous underwater vehicle (SAUVC) challenge is back.

#### What

Students from around the world undertake the challenge of building an underwater vehicle that has to perform a set of tasks autonomously. Tasks include following a path, dropping a ball in a bucket, bumping a flare and locating the exit which is demarcated with two acoustic pingers. All this has to be done without surfacing or touching the floor.

The competition also exposes students to a multitude of challenges faced in marine robotics. Some of the challenges are system engineering, automation and waterproofing to name a few.

There are teams from Canada, India, Malaysia and Singapore competing this year!

Viewing is open to public, so drop by to see AUVs swimming in a pool!  And also come meet the Subnero volunteers helping with the organization of the challenge.
