We are delighted to announce that we won the [DisTec Undersea Challenge](https://www.udt-global.com/about-the-challenge){:target="_blank"}.

The DisTec Undersea Challenge welcomed innovators and progressive organisations to showcase their solutions and disrupt the undersea defence environment as we know it.

Our team submitted a 5 minutes video about the Subnero Underwater Network (SUN), which saw us selected for the Grand Finals, yesterday, along side of Marcom Defence and [Seacraft](https://seacraft.eu/){:target="_blank"}.

After a presentation from all the finalists, we were announced as the winner of the competition.

The Grand Final can be watched [here](https://www.udt-global.com/finalists){:target="_blank"}.


We are now hoping that the travel restrictions, to and from Europe, will be soon lifted so that we can attend the [Undersea Defence Technology - UDT 2021 conference](https://www.udt-global.com/welcome) in Rostock, Germany, in December 2021.
