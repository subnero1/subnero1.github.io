Due to the pandemic, the physical Oceans 2020 Singapore has been postponed to 2024.

To make sure that we don't miss the exciting new papers and keep posted with the latest development, the IEEE OES decided to combined Oceans Singapore and US Gulf coast into a single virtual event: [Global Oceans 2020](https://global20.oceansconference.org/)

The Subnero team was very pleased to deliver a tutorial about practical underwater software-defined network. The team talked about the fundamentals of underwater communications and networking, and many practical tools and techniques to solve common challenges. In the hands-on sessions, participants were able to try out the demos themselves using the freely available UnetStack networking stack and simulator.

The session took place virtually  with a serie of 6 videos:

Part 1 - Introduction to underwater networks
Part 2 - Getting started with UnetStack
Part 3 - Multi-hop Links
Part 4 - Sensors and the internet
Part 5 - Localization
Part 6 - Summary and conclusion

Slides, code samples, and more information about the tutorials is available [here] (https://subnero.com/oceans20)

The videos are also available on our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnqY-RltGuGVwN6dFu_Z7zva17lMj7LPG).


We received some great feedback from the participants that generated interesting conversations.

We hope that we'll be able to meet with everyone soon.
