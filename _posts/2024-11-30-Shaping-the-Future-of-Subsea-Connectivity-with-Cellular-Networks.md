Subnero (along with our collaborators ST UIS) recently published a paper titled Design, Development, and Deployment of an Underwater Cellular Network, presented at the OCEANS Halifax conference. This work represents a significant leap toward realizing Subnero’s vision of establishing underwater connectivity akin to terrestrial wireless networks. The paper, available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10754077), details the development of a subsea cellular network enabling seamless communication and localization for underwater assets such as autonomous vehicles and sensors. The network was tested near Singapore, leveraging Subnero’s acoustic smart modems for robust communication and localization. The deployment demonstrated capabilities for real-time data exchange and continuous asset tracking, marking a major milestone in subsea networking innovation. We are actively working to improve and expand this network, integrating new capabilities to drive further innovation and application readiness.

This publication also underscores Subnero’s evolution from a National University of Singapore spin-off to a global leader in underwater wireless technology. It highlights our commitment to extending the internet into the subsea realm by creating scalable, cost-effective, and safe heterogeneous networks. The Singapore testbed is a tangible step toward transforming our decade-old dream into reality, supporting applications in research, energy, marine industries, and defense. By achieving this milestone, Subnero is cementing its position as the de-facto standard for underwater communication and sensing networks, pushing the boundaries of subsea innovation.
