Acoustic wireless communications has always been very challenging in shallow coastal waters as compared to deep ocean. This is due to a number of factors such as multi-path, Doppler due to strong currents, varying bathymetry etc. It gets even more challenging when you have to share the propagation channel with a number of marine vessels constantly injecting bubbles into the communication channel.

This is why, we at Subnero, constantly test our underwater acoustic modems at these challenging conditions, to push the limits of what is possible.

During February 2020, we conducted a set of experiments at the straits of Singapore, to test the communication range between two of our modems. The goal of the test was to establish a maximum communication range at a given data rate with more than 70% packet success ratio.

We are pleased to announce that the Subnero M25M series platinum edition modems have achieved over 2 km of communication range while configured at a data rate of 1.3 kbps (DATA channel) with a packet success ratio o 70% or more. The average depth of the communication channel was 15m. Both the transmitting and receiving modems were deployed at mid water column. However, due to very strong currents, the modems were at an angle of 45 deg at times. The strong currents also caused constant motion of the deployment platform and hence a Doppler of up to 4 knots was recorded. This also shows the Doppler resilience of the Subnero modems.

The modems used their OFDM modulation (DATA channel) with a 1/6th rate LDPC setting as the forward error correction. Over 5000 packets were transmitted in both directions and the results were tabulated.
