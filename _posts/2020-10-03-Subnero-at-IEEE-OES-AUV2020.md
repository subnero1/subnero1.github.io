Subnero attended its first virtual exhibition during [IEEE OES AUV2020](https://auv2020.org/){:target="_blank"} symposium.

The event took place online from the 29th of September to the 2nd of October 2020. It was originally planned to take place at St John's, NL, Canada. As a consequence of the pandemic, it took place virtually.

Despite being remote, the networking sessions were very lively and the panel discussions were very interesting. 

We loved being part of the event.

We look forward to attending the next one, hopefully in person.
