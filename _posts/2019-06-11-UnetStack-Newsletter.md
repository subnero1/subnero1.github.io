### Meet us at OCEANS' 19
We will be exhibiting at [OCEANS' 19](http://www.oceans19mtsieeemarseille.org/){:target="_blank"}, June 17th - 20th in Marseille, France, booth 34. We look forward to seeing you there! 

As part of the exhibition, we will be doing a presentation about software-defined underwater networks with UnetStack3 where we will talk about the latest version of our modems and the exciting projects in our pipeline (including high-speed communication modem and range extension using several modems). Join us on Wednesday the 19th of June at 11:10 am, in the Marseilleveyre room.

### UnetStack3 Beta release
After months of hard work, we are pleased to announce that we will be releasing UnetStack3 Beta during Oceans 19.
The new features are:
- New web-based IDE and simulator for easier development and testing of new protocols
- Short-circuiting: a novel stack-wide optimization that enhances performance in low-bandwidth networks
- Customizable frame formats for optimal performance in both small and large networks
- Physical service support for geotagging of each transmitted/received frame to enable new localization applications
- Stack agent support for time-to-live attributes in datagrams, enabling delay tolerant networks (DTN)
- Improved reliability of underwater links with multi-ACKs and rate-less erasure codes
- New responsive web interfaces for each node for better user experience
- A new shell extension mechanism for a customized user-friendly interaction
Python, Javascript and C API for extensibility
- New connector framework to support Ethernet, RS232 and other communication interfaces
- Bug fixes, usability improvements, and framework enhancements

We will also use UnetStack3 for the tutorial by Dr. John Potter, on Monday the 17th of June, at 8:30 am, to demonstrate real-time encoding, transmission, reception, and decoding of JANUS messages. 

Do not hesitate to approach any team member for information about this latest release.
