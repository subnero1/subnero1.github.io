Subnero at Oceans 2019, Marseille.

<b>OCEANS</b> is a bi-annual event for global marine technologists, engineers, scientists, students, government officials and lawyers.

These industry thought leaders gather for four days to highlight relevant topics and current trends, while creating a community of learners and influencers who consistently advance research, practices, and policies for the marine field.

The [Marine Technology Society](https://www.mtsociety.org/) and the [IEEE Oceanic Engineering Society](http://ieeeoes.org/) partner to present OCEANS. This prestigious conference and exhibition draws an audience of more than 2,000 attendees.

Subnero attends this event once a year, every year. Once again we made new acquaintances and caught up on the latest news from the industry. We were privileged to attend Dr John Potter’s tutorial on Janus and to do a demonstration using UnetStack3. Our booth was very well attended during the entire exhibition.

We can’t wait for Oceans 20 in Singapore! #Oceans20Singapore
