We are excited to launch the new long-range modems. The [L5L series](https://subnero.com/products/modem.html?&section=L5Lseries) long-range modems provide the capability to communicate underwater over 20 km in some of the most challenging underwater environments with data rates up to 100 bps, in a compact form factor.

## APPLICATION DIVERSITY
Ideal for applications such as passive acoustic monitoring, water quality monitoring, long range AUV command and control, seismic monitoring.

## SOFTWARE-DEFINED CORE
Users can fully configure the modulation and FEC parameters along with support for arbitrary waveform transmission and recording, through UnetStack APIs.

## SEAMLESS INTEGRATION
L5L series modems supports seamless integration with Subnero's M25M series modems to build true heterogenous networks.
