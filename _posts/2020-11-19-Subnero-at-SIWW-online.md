Due to the pandemic, Singapore International Water Week has been postponed to July 2021.
Instead of waiting until then, the organisors arranged a virtual show.

Subnero had a virtual booth with personnals available on line, permanently, to attend any visitors' queries.

The organisation of this show was very smooth and very well attended.

We are looking forward for the exhibition to take place, in person (hopefully), on the 20th - 24th of June 2021.
