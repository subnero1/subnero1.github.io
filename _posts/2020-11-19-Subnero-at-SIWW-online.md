Due to the pandemic, [Singapore International Water Week](https://www.siww.com.sg/) has been postponed to July 2021. 
Instead of waiting until then, the organizers arranged a virtual show.

Subnero had a virtual booth with personnel available online, permanently, to attend any visitors' queries.

We took this opportunity to display our new [white paper about the SWAN](https://subnero.com/brochures/SWAN-White-paper.pdf), describing the different components of our networked solution as well as to create new posters. We also display the details of our [underwater modems](https://subnero.com/brochures/Subnero-Modem-v4.0.pdf).

The show was very well attended.

We are looking forward for the exhibition to take place, in person (hopefully), on the 20th - 24th of June 2021.
