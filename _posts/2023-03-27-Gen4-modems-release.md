We're thrilled to introduce our newest product release - Generation 4 WNC product series! 

Equipped with our new and improved software, UnetStack4, our [generation 4 modems](https://subnero.com/products/wnc){:target=_blank} are designed to take your underwater communication to the next level. Our latest release includes a range of exciting features that will satisfy all of your deployment needs. 


Here are just a few highlights: 

- **OEM configuration:** A smaller version of the embedded configuration is perfect for easy integration into platforms with limited space. 
- **Deck configuration:** Our topside modems are now faster and easier to deploy with our new deck configuration. 
- **Titanium hull:** You can now go deeper than ever before, up to 6,000m! 
- **RS232:** For effortless connectivity, our modems now come with RS232 included as standard. 
- **Deep sleep mode & smart scheduler:** Save power during long deployments by choosing when and how often your modems communicate. 
- **Research edition:** Our new Delrin hull makes the modem more durable and perfect for at-sea deployments. 
- **Communication profiles:** You can now select the best configuration for your channel conditions with one click of a button. 
- **Link tuner:** Optimize modem settings for the best performance in any environment. 
- **Media agnostic connectivity:** With UnetStack4, our modems support a variety of links for multimodal connectivity such as UDP/IP, optical, and satellite links (and different acoustic frequency bands) for communication both above and underwater. 

We're excited to see how these new features will enhance your experience with our products.
