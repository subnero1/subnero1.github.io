We are proud to share that our paper titled [_Diver Communication and Localization System using Underwater Acoustics_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9389462){:target="_blank"} has been published in IEEE Xplore.

The paper is the fruit of several months of work by the Subnero team, in collaboration with [Dr. Mandar Chitre](https://arl.nus.edu.sg/people/mandar-chitre/){:target="_blank"}, of the [Acoustic Research Laboratories (ARL)](https://arl.nus.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"},

As the title indicates, the team used our software-defined underwater acoustic communication and localization technology to develop a diver communication and localization system to improve operational safety of underwater divers.

The paper was presented virtually by [Dr. Prasad Anjangi](https://subnero.com/people/prasad/) during [Global Oceans 2020](https://global20.oceansconference.org/) back in October 2020.
