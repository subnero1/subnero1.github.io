We are very proud to announce that the our paper about [Diver communication and localization paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9389462) has been published by IEEE Xplore.

The paper is the fruit of several months of work across the Subnero team and the collaboration of [Professor Mandar Chitre](https://arl.nus.edu.sg/people/mandar-chitre/){:target="_blank"}, of the [Acoustic Research Laboratories (ARL)](https://arl.nus.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"},

As the title indicates, the team has developed on an underwater communication system to improve divers safety using our off the shelf software-defined as well as newly designed devices.

The paper was presented virtually by Dr Prasad Anjangi during [Oceans 2020](https://global20.oceansconference.org/) back in October 2020.
