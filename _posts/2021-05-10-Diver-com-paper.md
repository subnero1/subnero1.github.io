We are very proud to announce that the our paper about Diver communication and localization paper has been published by IEEE Xplore.

The paper is the fruit of several months of work across the Subnero team with the collaboration of Prof Mandar from ARL.

.  The University of Haifa, deployed a Node configuration Subnero modem with an additional [co-processor](https://subnero.com/wnc/2018/11/17/Underwater-modem-with-a-coprocessor.html), that is configured with sonar-like functionalities, for their research.

[Contact us](https://subnero.com/contact/) to find out more about software-defined acoustic modems.
