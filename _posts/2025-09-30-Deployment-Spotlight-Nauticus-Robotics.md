**Singapore, September 30, 2025.** [Subnero Pte Ltd.](https://subnero.com/), a leader in underwater wireless communication solutions, today announced the release of a deployment spotlight showcasing the successful deep-water testing of its acoustic smart modems in collaboration with [Nauticus Robotics, Inc. (NASDAQ: KITT)](https://nauticusrobotics.com/).

The tests, conducted in the Gulf of Mexico, benchmarked Subnero’s deep-rated modem performance during vertical communication trials down to 2300 meters. Mounted on Nauticus’ flagship subsea robot Aquanaut, the modems maintained continuous communication with a topside unit deployed from a mothership. Results demonstrated robust performance across the full depth range, and the benefits of advanced Subnero software features.

“These results reaffirm our mission to deliver underwater communication solutions that work everywhere — from challenging tropical shallows to the deepest offshore fields,” said Manu Ignatius, CEO of Subnero. “Collaborations like this with Nauticus Robotics are critical in proving real-world performance and enabling the future of autonomous subsea operations.”

John Gibson, President and CEO of Nauticus Robotics, stated, “Aquanaut represents the future of subsea robotics, and Subnero’s modems are a critical enabler of our vision. These tests proved that reliable underwater communication can be achieved at ultra deep-water operational depths, giving us the conﬁdence to expand autonomous operations globally.”

The deployment spotlight underlines how Subnero’s technology supports a new class of subsea operations, unlocking greater efficiency and safety through autonomous systems.
