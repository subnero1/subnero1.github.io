There is nothing more satisfying than to see your technology and offerings perform better than your stated goals, especially during a joint field trials with an anchor client. Thanks to Chuck and Stuart from [Nauticus Robotics](https://nauticusrobotics.com/) for spending a week in Singapore to participate in our training session and the joint testing of our technology in local waters.

We are proud to share that our [WNC series](https://subnero.com/products/modem.html) of products not only performed well in the challenging conditions, but they dynamically adapt to provide the best performance in a given environment. This lets a user not worry about connectivity and focus more on the operations at hand and let our smart devices and software offerings manage the connectivity for you.

Thank you Nauticus Robotics for the positive feedback and continuing support. Looking forward to more milestones achieved together!
