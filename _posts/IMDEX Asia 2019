Subnero Pte Ltd had a very successful exhibition at Imdex Asia 2019, in Singapore.
The exhibition took place from Tuesday 14th of May to Thursday 16th of May.
During the first 2 days, our kiosk was busy with visitors from several different countries. There was a very good interest from all our visitors.
The last day saw us winning the Whatsnext pitching session competition.
What a way to finish an exhibition!
