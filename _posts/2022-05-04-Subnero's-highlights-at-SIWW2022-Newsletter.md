## Subnero's highlights at SIWW 2022

We had a great show at the Singapore International Water Week (SIWW) 2022 where we showcased the new version of our Subnero Water Assessment Network (SWAN). We are glad to have connected with many of you during the exhibition. Thank you for your support. Here are some highlights from the show.

### SWAN Live Showcase in Marina Bay

SWAN performed live demonstrations at the Marina Bay (facing The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands) on all three days of SIWW 2022.
