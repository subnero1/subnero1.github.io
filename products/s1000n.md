    <p><span class='orange'>Q: What is the S1000-N acoustic modem?</span></p>
    <p>A: The S1000-N is a new underwater acoustic modem that combines the power of the S1000 series modems from Popoto Modem and UnetStack from Subnero. The modems will have a fully functioning network stack out of the box, and offer a data rate of up to 10240 bps over a range of 3+ km.</p>
    <p><span class='orange'>Q: What is the advantage of combining the power of Popoto's S-series modems with the network stack of UnetStack?</span></p>
    <p>A: By combining these two technologies, the S1000-N offers a truly advanced underwater acoustic modem that is both compact and affordable. The modems are ideal for use in a wide range of underwater applications that need flexibility and affordability.</p>
    <p><span class='orange'>Q: What are the key features of the S1000-N modems?</span></p>
