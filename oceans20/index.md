Hello Oceans 20 attendees!

Welcome to the tutorial on **Practical Underwater Software-defined Networking**. Please read through the following page before or during the tutorial to better organize your learning through this virutal tutorial.

This page provides the link to the relevant code, slides and an optional questionnaire (for those who require CEU credits).

## Overview

This tutorial contains 6 parts. The PART 1 and PART 2 covers basics of setting up and using two and three node network. PART 3 expands this small network to a partially connected network by introducing more nodes and routes are established among nodes to achieve communication between nodes over multihop. PART 4 delves into the details of what a datagram and protocol constitutes and utilizes these concepts in getting data from a sensor node underwater to a node connected over internet on land. In PART 5, we utilize the network of nodes to localize a node and finally in PART 6, the conclusions and summary are presented.
