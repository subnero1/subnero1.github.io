## Systems Software Engineer

Do you love building systems from the ground up â€” tinkering with operating systems, drivers, and protocols, and making hardware and software really talk to each other? At Subnero, we design and build the technology that enables communication underwater â€” one of the most challenging networking environments youâ€™ll ever encounter.

At the heart of this is **UnetStack**, our open software framework for underwater networking. As a systems software engineer, youâ€™ll make sure UnetStack runs efficiently on embedded Linux platforms, integrates cleanly with diverse hardware, and performs reliably in the field.

Weâ€™re looking for someone whoâ€™s excited about **embedded Linux, drivers, networking protocols, and programming in C, Python, Rust, and Java** â€” and who wants to join a small, deeply technical team building real-world systems that bridge hardware, operating systems, and communications.

ðŸ‘‰ **Fresh graduates are welcome**: if youâ€™ve explored Linux on a Raspberry Pi, tinkered with embedded systems, weâ€™d love to hear from you.

**As a systems software engineer at Subnero, you will:**

* Customize and optimize **embedded Linux distributions** to support UnetStack and related software.
* Configure and debug Linux at the system level (**bootloaders, device trees, systemd services, networking**).
* Enhance and support **UnetStack (Java-based)** protocol agents on embedded platforms.
* Write and maintain **C and Rust** code for low-level system components that UnetStack depends on.
* Use **Python** for testing, automation, and deployment scripting.
* Integrate a variety of communication hardware â€” **sensors, modems** â€” into UnetStack.
* Improve and maintain **build systems** (Makefiles, cross-compilation toolchains) and automation scripts (Github Actions).
* Profile and optimize system performance so that UnetStack can operate efficiently in **resource-constrained environments**.
* Validate functionality and performance in the field with real hardware.
* Collaborate closely with hardware engineers, application developers, and researchers to shape the system end-to-end.

**You will thrive in this role if you:**

* Are comfortable digging into **operating system internals** (Linux configuration, cross-compilation, **systemd service management**).
* Enjoy writing code in **C and Rust** for system-level programming, and **Python** for testing and automation.
* Are comfortable working with networking concepts, like **subnetting, routing, DHCP, and DNS**.
* Appreciate the craft of **hardware/software integration** and enjoy debugging tricky low-level problems.
* Believe in documenting your work â€” for colleagues today and your future self tomorrow.
* Value **clear communication, curiosity, and persistence** as much as technical skill.
* Enjoy working in field settings, testing systems in real-world conditions.

**Before applying, you might want to:**

* Explore **[UnetStack](https://unetstack.net/)** to see the systems youâ€™ll be supporting.
* Try the **[Unet simulator](https://subnero.com/products/unetsim.html)** and **[VirtualAcousticOcean](https://github.com/org-arl/VirtualAcousticOcean.jl)** to understand underwater networking challenges.
* Experiment with **Raspberry Pi** or similar boards: set up Linux, configure device trees, and run a program as a **[systemd service](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.service.html)**.
* Practice coding in **C, Python, and Rust**, and get comfortable navigating a Java-based application ecosystem.
* Read about embedded Linux workflows like **[Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/)**, **[Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/)**, and cross-compilation.
* Think about how youâ€™d optimize a system running on limited resources in unpredictable environments.

**This role could be a great fit if you are:**

* A seasoned engineer with experience in **embedded Linux, drivers, systemd services, and low-level programming**.
* A **recent graduate** who has tinkered with **Linux internals, Raspberry Pi projects, or embedded systems** â€” and has coded in **C, Python, Rust, or Java**.
* Someone who likes working close to the metal and doesnâ€™t mind rolling up their sleeves to debug gnarly system issues â€” especially when the end result is making UnetStack run better.

**Life at Subnero**

We are a small, highly technical, and collaborative team working on cutting-edge underwater networking technology. Our values show up in daily life:

* **Rigor** in the way we design, build, and test systems.
* **Curiosity** in the way we constantly learn new things and explore new ideas.
* **Responsibility** in owning problems end-to-end and helping each other.
* **Transparency** in how we communicate and share ideas.

**How to Apply:**
